# Uber Rides Insights Analysis

## Overview

This project leverages advanced SQL techniques to analyze Uber rides data and extract actionable insights. The analysis focuses on identifying key ride metrics, such as peak ride times, popular pickup/drop-off locations, and trends in ride duration and distance. To deliver comprehensive operational insights, the project utilizes subqueries, window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and aggregation functions.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Analysis:** Examine Uber ride data to understand ride frequency, temporal patterns, and geographic trends.
- **Advanced SQL Techniques:** Employ subqueries, window functions, and CTEs to create complex, efficient queries.
- **Insight Generation:** Provide actionable insights on peak periods, high-demand areas, and ride performance metrics to support operational decisions.

## Key Features

- **Data Preparation:** Cleans and filters raw Uber ride data for accurate analysis.
- **Advanced Querying:** Uses:
  - **CTEs and subqueries** to structure complex queries.
  - **Window functions** to compute running totals and rankings.
  - **Aggregations** (SUM, COUNT, AVG) to summarize ride metrics.
- **Outcomes:**
  - Identifies **peak ride times and days**.
  - Reveals popular **pickup and drop-off locations**.
  - Analyzes trends in **ride duration, distance, and fare**.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AIShaktiNeil/SQL-Projects.git

   ```

2. **Open the SQL Script:**
   - Locate and open the `Uber_rides_insights.sql` file in your preferred SQL client.

3. **Execute the Script:**
   - Ensure your SQL environment is connected to the Uber rides dataset.
   - Run the script to execute all queries and generate the insights.

4. **Review the Results:**
   - Analyze the output of the advanced queries to explore ride patterns, trends, and operational insights.

## Tools & Technologies

- **SQL:** Advanced querying techniques.
- **SQL Client:** Compatible with major SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
